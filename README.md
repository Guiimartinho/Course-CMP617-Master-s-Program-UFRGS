# CMP617 – Special Topics in Computer Science DCXVII:  
## Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval

This repository contains projects and assignments developed during the graduate-level course **CMP617 – Special Topics in Computer Science DCXVII: Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval**, part of the Master's Program at the **Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)**.

### 📚 Course Overview

The CMP617 course focuses on the fundamentals and advanced techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Retrieval (IR)**. The course aims to provide both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience with real-world applications involving textual data.

Topics covered include:
- Text preprocessing and normalization
- Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization
- Vector space models and word embeddings
- Text classification and clustering
- Information retrieval systems and ranking algorithms
- Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, MAP)
- Deep learning for NLP
- Transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT)
- Ethical considerations in NLP and IR
